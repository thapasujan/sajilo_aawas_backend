## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a file named:

```
.env
```

Use the provided `.env.example` as a reference:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your actual values.
Example variables might include:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

📌 **Important:** `.env` is ignored in Git and should NOT be committed. — this keeps your credentials secure.

```bash
npm run dev
```

or
